Shell highlighter.

Takes input from stdin and highlights it based on a regular expression.  Multiple colour support.

TODO:
-> Add background colour highlighting support (see highlight.h)
-> Multiple matches per line.
-> Add option for REG_EXTENDED flag to be added (right now it uses grep-style regex rather than newer egrep-style).
